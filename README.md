## 📖 Overview
**YOSHI!** was born from the fear of "Doxing" (identifying individuals from photos). 

While standard metadata strippers just delete tags, "Internet Detectives" are relentless. This tool **reconstructs the image pixel-by-pixel** onto a brand-new canvas, physically severing Exif, GPS, and hidden "MakerNotes."

For anyone who wants to avoid a permanent "Digital Tattoo," YOSHI! provides a definitive "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) for your peace of mind.

## ✨ Features
* **🌍 Bilingual Safety Modes**
    * **English**: Featuring the global engineering standard: **"LGTM! 👉😸✨"**
    * **Japanese**: Featuring the cult-classic "Genba Neko" style: **"ヨシッ！ (Yoshi!)"**
* **🛡️ Physical Pixel Wash**
    * Uses `Image.new` + `putdata` + `exif=b""`. It doesn't just edit; it rebuilds. [cite: 2026-01-27]
* **🚀 High-Speed "YOSHI!" Workflow**
    * Simple Drag & Drop interface. Wash and verify continuous batches of "field photos" in seconds.
* **👁️ Absolute Verification**
    * Drop the washed file back into the tool. When the cat says **"LGTM!"**, you can be 100% sure there's nothing left.

## 🖼️ How it Works
1.  **Scan**: The tool uncovers the hidden "footprints" in your dropped image.
2.  **Wash**: With one click, it extracts raw pixel data and reconstructs a clean image. [cite: 2026-01-27]
3.  **Save**: Generates a world-class clean image with a `_washed` suffix.
4.  **Verify**: Re-drop it yourself to confirm the **"LGTM!"** pose.
